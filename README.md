# AboutMeandPinterestEx
I combined the about me and Pintrest ex 
*Challenges:
-Getting my website to be responsive, i am not quite there yet,
but with future weeks of practice i will get it.
-CSS Grid Layout: this was my first attempt at the grid layout.
I like FLexbox, but i will be doing most of my websites in the grid layout as it is more flexible.
-Navgation Bar
Fully functional nav bar on each page, they are ugly but they work.

**I will use this a test website to practice new things as i learn them.
